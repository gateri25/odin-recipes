     <ol>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugar
            The first thing you'll do is beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (hand-held or stand mixer) until the mixture is light and fluffy. Depending on the mixer you use, this could take four to five minutes</li>
         <li>Add eggs and vanilla
            After the butter and sugar are creamed, add the eggs and vanilla. Many home cooks like to add the eggs one at a time.</li>
        <li>Add flour, baking powder, and salt
                Measure these dry ingredients into a separate bowl, whisk them together thoroughly, then turn your mixer to a lower speed and stir the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture</li>
        <li>Cover and chill the dough
                Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. This firms up the butter in the dough and helps prevent the cookies from spreading as they bake.</li>
